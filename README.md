# Power Overload

## Features
- Power poles may explode if their network's total consumption goes over the maximum consumption for that power pole type
- Separate your network into subnetworks using transformers, but ensure that each subnetwork does not get too large!
- You will usually want your subnetworks to only contain one type of power pole, so different power pole types do not automatically connect to each other

## Tips
- You'll want to have a central 'spine' of tier 3/4 poles. Use transformers to branch off it into subnetworks with tier 1/2 poles or substations
- Don't forget the vanilla methods of removing wires: `Shift + Click` on a power pole to remove all wires and 'connect' two connected poles with copper cable to disconnect them
- You may find [Wire Shortcuts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/WireShortcutshttps://mods.factorio.com/mod/WireShortcuts) useful for connecting/disconnecting wires and [Rate Calculator](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RateCalculator) useful for ensuring that subnetworks' power requirements are not too big

## Future updates
- Allow transformer wire connections to be included in blueprints
- Support for overhaul mods: if you would like one in particular, let me know. Since I haven't played any, balance suggestions would be helpful

## Graphics
The tier 4 power pole uses the pre-0.17 "Big electric pole" graphics and the transformer uses the current power switch graphics. If you would be interested in creating better graphics for either of these, let me know.
